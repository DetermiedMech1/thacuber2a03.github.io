hey, what's up.
===========================================================================

I do a bunch of stuff online:

- [I'm in Mastodon.](https://mastodon.gamedev.place/@thacuber2a03)
- [I'm also in cohost.](https://cohost.org/thacuber2a03) not exactly
  active though.
- legally (not really) I have to plug [my Twitter account](https://twitter.com/thacuber2a03) (I'm not calling it X, cope)

you probably know me from:

- [the Tetris clone I made](https://github.com/thacuber2a03/Blockdate)
  for the [Playdate](https://play.date) console. it got a bit popular.
- some plugins I\'ve made for the [Lite
    XL](https://github.com/lite-xl/lite-xl) text editor, namely
    - all modifications to the pack of caret plugins
      **custom\_caret**, **smoothcaret** and **motiontrail**.
