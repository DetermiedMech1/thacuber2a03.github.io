===========================================================================

I do a bunch of stuff online:

    active though.

you probably know me from:

- [the Tetris clone I made](https://github.com/thacuber2a03/Blockdate)
  for the [Playdate](https://play.date) console. it got a bit popular.
- some plugins I\'ve made for the [Lite
    XL](https://github.com/lite-xl/lite-xl) text editor, namely
    - all modifications to the pack of caret plugins
      **custom\_caret**, **smoothcaret** and **motiontrail**.
