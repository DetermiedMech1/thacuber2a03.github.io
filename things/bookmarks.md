# bookmarks

this page hosts the various links to tools/games/resources/anything I find fun, interesting and/or useful.

I describe just enough to explain each link, not going into too much detail unless I feel like commenting on it or if it would otherwise be hard to navigate/understand.

they're not sorted in any order, but the categories are.
here are links to each category:

- [game development](#gamedev)
- [programming languages](#proglangs)
- [programing language development](#pldev)
- [code repositories](#repos)
- [other resource compilations](#infocomps)

and [here's the button to go back](/).

<h3 id="gamedev">game development</h3>

- [Coding Math](https://www.youtube.com/@codingmath): a series of videos on various math topics related to and useful for game development, ranging from physics, to tweening, to a bit of UI. says "ongoing", but the last video released 7 years ago.

- [Game Physics Cookbook](https://gamephysicscookbook.com/): a guide on the algebra and math behind physics engines. I don't like it a lot because it's written like if it was a highschool class, but it's nice regardless.

<h3 id="pldev">programming language development</h3>

- [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com): a book that teaches the reader how to make two interpreters, a treewalk one written in Java and a bytecode one in C for an ad-hoc programming language called Lox. made by the creator of the Wren programming language.

- [Let's Build a Compiler, by Jack W. Crenshaw](https://compilers.iecc.com/crenshaw/): a fifteen-part series written from 1988 to 1995 about writing a compiler from a custom-made language to Motorola 68k assembly language, in Pascal.

<h3 id="proglangs">programming languages</h3>

- [The Wren programming language](https://wren.io/): an elegant, object oriented programming language implemented in "around 4000 semicolons".

- [funk](https://github.com/egordorichev/funk): a programming language that only has functions.

- [Uxn](https://100r.co/site/uxn.html), and consequently, [Varvara](https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/varvara.html): a really small computing stack, designed to be really resilient, under the idea of permacomputing. Varvara embeds Uxn and extends it with a variable-sized screen, file and console I/O, controller, mouse and keyboard input, audio capabilities, etc.

<h3 id="repos">code repositories</h3>

- [rxi](https://github.com/rxi): makes really useful and varied libraries, mostly in C and Lua. developer of lite, json.lua, microui, fe and many, many others. I am aware that this is a user, not a code repository.

<h3 id="infocomps">other resource compilations</h3>

- [XXIIVV](https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/index.html), written by the designer and developer of the Uxn computing stack, Devine Lu Linvega ([@neauoire@merveilles.town](https://merveilles.town/@neauoire)).

- [Build Your Own X](https://github.com/codecrafters-io/build-your-own-x).

- [snaptoken](https://viewsourcecode.org/snaptoken).
